By Prince Namwali

Before I present my analysis and provide solutions, it only seems fair to tell you a little bit about myself. My name is Prince Namwali and I have lived in Malawi for 13 years, before I came to America to pursue my education. I have currently been in America for 5 years as I speak, while keeping in touch with my home country. Even without my presence in Malawi, I assure you, I know the struggles within that country and it keeps getting worse. However, what I am about to present to you is from the paradigm of 13 year old and the consumption of stories henceforth. I want people to understand that, I know that change is a big word and the most difficult process. However, with open ears, open hearts and open minds, we can gradually draw the power of change and alter the outcome of fate; if such a thing does exist.

Where do we start? This is a question I have seen come up in multiple Malawian community discussions online and in the physical world. This question has immense weight behind it, which makes people lose hope. When people start to brainstorm they are submerged in fear and the word that comes out of their mouth is impossible. I understand why people come up to this conclusion because of all the problems our country has such as corruption, theft, poor healthcare, unsafe water, electricity issues, high cost of living, emergency responder issues, high levels of unemployment, expensive education on all levels and much more.

To present these problems in a less subtle way, I will tell you a short story I created. Keep in mind that the story is completely fictional, despite using real places. My name is Mabvuto and my parents abandoned me when I was young. More precisely, they left me when I was still in primary school. School was too expensive, so I dropped out, my body was weak from all the unclean water I was exposed to and my parents barely made enough money for us to survive. My dad was laid off because they recently found out that he never went to college. My mother was the only one working by selling kaunjika or cheap clothing. My father would always beat my mother because she was trying to pay the bills first, but he demanded that he got his first share. My father would later use that money to buy Malawi gin and waste it on tchipisi chapa chiwaya or fries for short. The day my parents abandoned me was the time by mother was arrested for a crime she never committed. I couldn’t believe that my rumors and lies could constrict someone’s freedom, without any evidence whatsoever. The same day that my mother was arrested, my father came home drunk and beat my sister when they go into an argument. My sister was stabbed in the stomach and my dad fled. The police arrived late and he was long gone. The ambulance was late, but my sister, mwanaalirenji was rushed to a hospital. She was on oxygen, but she died when the electricity went out as it usually does every day. My uncle took me in and I had place to call home. My aunt made money by providing services with her body, but my uncle never knew. One day, robbers came into my uncle’s house with zikwanje or machetes and robbed us of everything. I am homeless vagabond in Lilongwe trying to survive by digging through trash. I am blame everyone and this broken country for my problems. Brothers and sisters, friends and family my story is not the full picture of this country, but from my eyes and experiences this is Malawi.

I hope that story resounded with you, as it did with me. Moving on, I would like to point out two notable observations from my childhood years in Malawi. I will keep my point short and explicit as possible. Number one “Most Malawians are lazy.” I know what you may be thinking, that’s an outrageous statement, but we can’t deny truth. Some, if not most, in this room can definitely picture this because that’s the currently reality. Number two “We think too little of ourselves” I think Malawi’s biggest enemy is its own people. We bring each other down with criticism and we take it upon ourselves. We live our lives encompassed by lies that can’t be proved and let someone’s criticism define us. Without any further ado, let’s dive into the most important segment.

How do we solve the problems I have listed so far? Ladies and Gentleman the part that you have all been waiting for... First and foremost, I believe that we can fix our country by implementing what China has been doing all these years and continues to do. The answer might have sparked in some of you and it’s a system called manufacturing. Malawi is a country that has multiple natural resources and places that remain undiscovered, till this day. We should take the initiative to utilize these resources wisely and cautiously because we must avoid destroying our country in the process. How do we do this? As some of you may know, we are losing control of our land to the Chinese, Indians and other foreigners that come into our country. We need to take control of our country first and we can do so by investing in real state or in simple words, we buy our land back (we take complete control of our country, though we already own it). In this process we can use the land to build infrastructure for manufacturing as well as buying and renovating pre-existing buildings. After the plan has been successfully executed, we can advance by forming a system for these buildings. The first step would be to make the process of manufacturing require little to no electricity. The second step would be to advise or set a fixed salary for employees. This will get rid of the animosity that arises from paying others more. If successful, this system will slowly fix our currency and will enable us to export more than we currently import. Land is the most essential mark in business and that is how the plan will affect the plans that follow. Aside from manufacturing, I believe implementing greenhouses will enable us to advance and take farming to a new level. From there we can begin to invest in clean energy such as solar and windmills. The other possible changes we can make is in our education system. Our education system is outdated though you might say it’s better than the American system of education. We need to change it in a way that makes the teaching more practical because most people who graduate from college have so much theory, but can’t apply it the real world. Aside from practicality, I believe teaching about mental health would be a great solution, along with introducing some new classes. I believe every Malawian should have this course of mental health because people to need know how to take care of their brains and also engrail into the minds of our people that mental disorders are real. Depression is a real disease and it should be treated as such. We need to eliminate the impaired mindset of our people that says “Mental disorders such as depression are not real, they are made up by white people, mentally impaired people practice ufiti or witchcraft.” In a simple list format, the solutions are as follows: Real Estate, Manufacturing, Greenhouses, Solar Power, Windmills and Mental Health Classes. I Realize this is a short list, but we need to start somewhere.

At the pinnacle of civilization land is the most important and second to that is food. With these two marks in place everything else falls in place. The reformation plan is very clear as day, but the tough question to answer is who? Who will implement this plan to fruition? Are we going to wait for the aid of neighboring or foreign country? Will more mission trips solve the bigger issue? Will some celebrity or rich person fix the country? Are we going to lose the internal battle and sell the country? Will adopting another currency fix the issue? Should we just leave the issue to the government? Are we going to keep blaming our history? Should we just give up and just say God will fix it? I leave the question for you to decide, but if you look around the room, the answer may not be too far to find. Thank you!

Revised Plan

Throughout my surfing on the web and drowning in a deluge stream of information i have arrived at the core. I understand that the problem in Malawi can't be fixed with the previous aforementioned tasks. The tasks are simply arduous and bring about more conflict. I witnessed local businesses in Malawi get burned down, property stolen and left in absolute shambles. The recent demonstrations were so extreme to the point that the US Embassy offices were shut down completely, preventing people from attaining legal documentation required for travel. The tension still resides as Malawians have to travel to neighboring countries like Zambia in order to utilize the Embassies. There is a travel cost and the cost thats charged at the office itself. With the current economic standard most Malawians are making below the poverty line making it the worlds poorest countries. The poverty that Malawi faces isn’t that of material wealth, but that of monetary wealth. The Malawi currency known as the Kwacha is not enough to sustain its people with the high cost of living and ridiculous currency conversion value. How can a country be poor in the monetary sense when it has the ability to print and set rules on it? Through further digging and discovery i found something shocking. The Malawi Kwacha is dare do i say the only currency in the world that has never gone digital or that its only accessible to few. Adopting pre-existing currency would not fix the problem because i dont think thats what the country needs. Adopting another currency like the dollar would make life difficult for everyone in Malawi including Malawians in the US that rely on the ridiculous currency conversion that make them seem like rich people when they visit their home country. What Malawi needs is a currency thats not regulated or centralized by the corrupt-greedy government thats crippling the thousands of innocent people and bestowing a dark shadow of hopelessness for the future generation. What Malawi needs is a decentralized, peer to peer connected system of currency known as cryptocurrency.

The Greater the Suffering the Greater the Peace: The New Story of Malawi

Malawi is still the warm heart of Africa, but this time around that saying has much more profound meaning, highly sensible and overall self evident. Back in the days, everyone had given up on Malawi. They called it a lost cause, a helpless case, an impossible feat, a place resistant to change, but the tides have changed, so have the rankings. Malawi held its place in the past as one of the top three poorest countries on planet Earth. Malawi was in Second Place, North Korea was in first place and Cuba third. In the continent of Africa we held our place as the poorest within, but now we are in the top 10 most thriving and developed nations. The times surely have changed. Malawi would never have been able to change , if it wasn't for them. Malawians were selfish and would never have been able to help their fellow Malawians, despite achieving greatness in other countries. These Malawians could never share or contribute to change because they were too busy enjoying their life in countries like America, Europe, Canada, Australia or any English speaking country for that matter. Malawians who acquired the ability to travel to other countries were stuck with the same mentality and they believed seconding some spare currency through moneygram or western union would solve the bigger picture. The Malawians who traveled overseas ridiculed their own people by sending cheap stuff. These people were selfish and only cared for their families. These Malawians were part of the bigger problem as they sought to build businesses to exploit their own people. They built big houses and bought land because their currency converted to ours was much greater. Malawians travelling overseas simply added more fuel to the everburning fire of problems, without tackling the core of the problem. Malawians were never able to truly help each other. Malawians were not the answer it was them. The foreigners were the answer to our problems all along. It was those men and women who had less melanin that had the absolute power to change the internal and external systems of Malawi. Their aid seemed like an invasion because they targeted our corrupt government and distrust. We were fearful of their aid because of the preconceived notion that history repeats itself. However, things were different this time around because they did not force us to learn their culture or language. They simply came to us with the intention of doing business. Their business model was just too perfect because to the weak and hopeless Malawins that we were it all sounded good. Their model was nearly perfect without flaws that our people started getting hints that it was probably a good idea to learn their language and culture, if we truly wanted to reach deeper understanding. The chinese weren’t here to steal our resources like the British did in the past. The Chinese were here to establish their business model that fits perfectly with the current snapshot of our country and also aid us in the process. Eventually they introduced their languages into our schools, but that was just the beginning. They replaced our broken British school system of education with their improved education system adopted from their motherland. They taught our men and women valuable skills. Their system of education empowered us to soar through the sky and reach for the heavens. They fixed our problems step by step and made us better citizens of our own country. Young men and women were more practical, outgoing and no longer had the hopeless mentality residing in them. Their system of education was immensely wonderful and they even had foreign exchange programs. The chinese and other foreigners were the answer to transforming Malawi all along. The new Malawi is full of possibilities and opportunities that were never available in the past. Our current president of Malawi is actually a foreigner, I won't reveal his origin because i will leave that for you people to guess. If it begins with a C you are probably not wrong and he is fluent in our language. Malawi’s government is dare I say different, it's not a democracy, but it's not a bad one either. However, the lovely changes we have in the new Malawi didn’t come for free. Young men and women are now a slave to their own country. The old, corrupt people in our government are the ones to blame. The Chinee came with pure intention of business and it just so happens that business was easier to do with people that had lost trust in each other (Malawians). The Chinese shifted from business to ownership which has helped solve the overpopulation crisis they had in China. Young men and women are left with two options. Before we go further into the detailed snapshot of the New Malawi, it is essential to look at the slow progression and signs. Looking at the How is just as important looking at the Now. Malawi is way better than it was before period. However, i am being selfish and the story would leave you in a loop of suspense. At the core, the old Malawi had five problems and the rest could be fixed by tackling those five. The Chinese managed to tackle those issues slowly and effectively, that there was no more room for doubt. The first step was tackling the first problem, Electricity. You might be thinking, why electricity? To get into why, its necessary to look at what problems having electricity eliminates. With electricity, one of the most important things is the equipment used in medical facilities like hospitals and clinics. Without it the availability of XRays, ECG’s, Blood Test Machines and other essential medical technologies would be non existent. Getting sick in Malawi is the equivalent of becoming a stray dog in the wild. Some people choose to live with the illness till the day they die assuming it doesnt kill them fast, if untreated. Some people fortunate enough are able to get assistance from oversea hospitals. Some people die in hospitals all because the power went out. In the simplest manner, the presence of electricity is a requirement for advanced healthcare. Most of the deaths in Malawi are from people who could have lived longer if only our healthcare system was advanced. A second importance that comes with electricity is business. It was nearly impossible to run a business in Malawi if electricity was a problem. Those payment terminals should be expected to run if the electricity was constant. Imagine not being able to get your paycheck all because the electricity was out. Electricity is useful for running all the appliances that we have in our homes. One of those appliances is our phones. Not being able to contact someone just because their phone died and the electricity went out was a bad combination. For those who are privileged enough to have a fridge the importance of having some your food kept at a certain temperature is beneficial for the quality and shelf life. In the bigger picture, the availability of electricity 24/7 impacts your quality of life, communication and healthcare. The presence of undying electricity solved 80% of Malawi's problems. Windmills and Solar Panels became widely available and were planted in multiple homes. Farms and even rural villages have windmills. Almost every household has a solar panel installed on their rooftops. The phone we have today come preinstalled with solar panels. ESCOM still exists, but there are more companies than ever before that provide sustainable and affordable electricity. Load shedding is the thing of the past, although ESCOM still practices it because when the power demanded on the system exceeds supply. If load shedding is not carried out, it may result in the system collapsing. I don’t know why that happens, but all i can say is that there system is outdated. After electricity was no longer a problem they tackled the main problem that plagued our country

The second step…

The Final Story

Malawi does have a future, but i fear for it. I will have been a citizen of Japan or another Asian country like Singapore, China, South Korea.The future of malawi is bright, but its people will be left with 2 options. Learn and play the game or learn and flee.

In the end the final decision we all must take

Make or break, will decide what will be and our destiny

If we lose the fight the chinese will finally tell burn in hell

There will be no after, be no other day

I can sense now its all become clear to see

Youre no good and you mean no good treacherously

Cometh the hour of our reckoning and we will be ready

Cometh the hour the messenger from hell we dreaded




Your college degree is useless because what really matters is the value you create for others. I know people who have masters , doctorates, especially here in Malawi. To those people I ask, what have you done for your country? What value have you created, aside from indulging in your own self interests?

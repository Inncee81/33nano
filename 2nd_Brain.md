---

1. **Steal like an artist** <!-- Attributed to a famous book of the same name -->
- _never start from scratch_ <!-- Tabularasa should be limited to birth, not creativity. A blank canvas causes a creative block in the creator. Starting from scratch is a disservice to oneself for the time allotted to occupy and fill the canvas is exponential. Save -->
- _remix_ <!-- Originality doesn't exist, that's just the truth, but some find it offensive and pointlessly try to  argue about a true fact. Its even in a Bible Verse, there is nothing new under the sun. Everything is out there is a remix of something else. Even philosophers stole and remixed ideas from other philosophers. Developers clone or remix preexisting ideas into something else. Lyft is a clone of Uber. Doordash is a clone of Uber Eats, or which ever came first. All search engines are a clone of each other, some with more features, some with less (predictive searching, privacy focused, minimal, dark theme...). Most pop songs use the same chord progressions as other songs. In fact the app that I wish to create, Super Psyche, is a remix of abundant research in Neuroscience and all the neuro related content that I have consumed. -->
- _start with abundance_
2. **Kaizen**
- _small simple steps (timed progress, build up)_
- _Daily (not everything has to be hard)_
- _Rome wasn't built in a day_ <!-- Another great example is one of moving out. You don't just move out to an empty apartment or house. You slowly collect the things you need over time and then the move is easier. You have everything you need to continue living without worries. -->
3. **Outsource your brain**
- _don't use your brain to store info (there is a limit aka working memory)_ <!-- -->
- _write it down, use your devices(smartphone, tablet, laptop/PC)_
4. **Timeless Learning** 
- _taking action is the best way to learn_
- _you only know what you make_
- _don't wait until you become an expert just do it_
- aka Just in time learning
5. **Projects over categories**
- _Deadline_ 
- _SMART Goal_ - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant & Time Based
6. **Keep your ideas moving**
- _reuse ideas_
- _If you are stuck move to something else and come back (you can't force yourself into a state of flow)_
7. **Future Self**
- _make it easier for your future self_
- _In case of brain health decline you have something to
  fall back to_

_We live in an Information Age. Our quality of life, income, success, are all tied to our fluency with information: Our ability to capture it and share it with the world. Tiago Forte's Building a Second Brain is a great solution to this knowledge conquest.Listed below are the fundamental principles of building a second Brain. These principles are highlited in the official course, as well as the official podcast._ 

1. **Borrowed Creativity** - There are no new ideas in the world - all creative output is remixed from constant creative input. What you see when people output great accomplishments and idea is only the end result of a lot of processing and storing of inspirations. Your output is limited to the quality of your inputs. Thus if you want better output, change the way you consume. When you consume with a view to producing something, you have higher standards, you are much less willing to waste time. Dealing with information overload: When you start being more discerning, you start filtering a lot more of the noise. You start seeing how rare it is to see truly good content/ideas out there. When you have a well organized second brain of notes, you start from a higher starting point than when you are only drawing from your best thinking in the moment. You need to be able to pull on accumulated wisdom from yourself and others over a long span of time. It feels like you're skipping steps, because you're borrowing others' thinking.

2. **The Capture Habit** - Write It Down! Any insight, any possibly relevant content, before you even know you're going to use it. this habit comes from David Allen's Getting Things Done. Your mind has limited working memory. You alone can't hold on to the best ideas and information AND also keep looking out and processing new ones. People don't do this because they don't value their own ideas. "Someone must have thought of this before". "I'll never be able to act on it". This is a self fulfilling prophecy if you dont take the basic action of capturing. You have no idea where it's going to end up - You can only connect the dots backwards. Listen to your intuition on what to capture - physical responses - heartbeat, eyes dilation, excitement, energy. Believe that your ideas and perspective matters. When you create content, it's much harder to sit down and just pour out great insight after great insight. It's much easier to collect and store this over time and then organize them later. When you have all these raw materials taken care of by your notetaking system, you start being to do higher level work - spontaneity, creativity, adaptation. Offload mundane details to computers.

 3. **Idea Recycling** - Similar to Borrowed Creativity, but instead you are borrowing from your past self. You don't really remember what your past self knew. You don't really know what your future self will want. Only thing you can do is pass ideas through time. Most ideas start extremely simple - email, tweet, text message. Take the same idea and recycle it through various contexts and grow it each time. Invest more in the 10% that gets traction. It's probably something that is obvious to you but amazing to others. Unlike physical things, Ideas get better when you recycle them. It's too risky to build everything from scratch every time with no priors. The only way to get around this is to keep outputting and testing in small ways. Build a compounding asset of intellectual capital that will last your lifetime. Productivity: Never do the same work twice. Most things you do are comprised of components - reuse them. Over time, more and more of what you do can be reused templates from the past. 
 
 4. **Projects over Categories** - Knowledge is a Factory, not a Library. A Factory is linear - things come in, are processed, and then output is produced. When you have real intellectual output, people can't take that away from you. Libraries try to categorize everything into the Dewey Decimal System. It works for that - anyone can find things through that system. But the more you put into one category, the more there's just a ton of stuff in that category and it is overwhelming and useless. We aren't optimizing for everyone - we are just working to improve Personal Knowledge Management. Projects are the best unit of measurement for your output as a Knowledge Worker. Not Ideas - not very concrete. Not Goals - too long term. Projects are more medium term, specific, more concrete, and you can check it off and remove/archive it so you can take on something new. Categories are consumption oriented, Projects are production oriented. You want to organize your knowledge according to projects. So you should know your current project list and store ideas directly into that current project. This way, when you're in the mood/time to produce, you can start right away, instead of going to look for things. 
 
  5. **Slow Burns** - Heavy Lifting is when you block off a week or a month and just blast through your project. Over time, that time available for Heavy Lifts gets scarcer - kids, marriage, employees, other responsibilities. Slow Burns is the opposite. You collect things in the background. You can even make wedding planning stress free this way. Intellectual work can be spread out over time. It allows it to be more enjoyable, spontaneous, creative, critical (editing with some distance) etc. But primarily less stress :) Analogy - Predators need to eat now - they work fast and intensely with scarcity. Scavengers work in abundance - we are living in a sea of creative inputs - dont have to look very hard around you to find inspiration.
  
   6. **Start With Abundance** - Most people start with scarcity - a blank canvas; they refuse to start a project until they have everything they need already assembled. But it also means you have to store notes on everything to give yourself the best shot. This is how Big Breaks happen - they don't wait for you to be ready. They tend to happen at the worst time. But at least you will have given yourself the best starting point when it comes. You can decide to be wealthy in the world of ideas. All you need is some intentionality to cultivate them. Ideas are free, plentiful, and you can store them forever and nobody can take them away from you. 
   
   7. **Intermediate Packets** - Intermediate Packets are parts of your work. Concrete parts of your work. Every piece of your work is built out of parts - so break down your work. Instead of writing a full email, write the outline of your email. Instead of writing a full book, you get an agent, get an editor, get a contract, get an outline for a book proposal, on and on. It becomes a lot less intimidating when you break it down. It's really hard to fail at Intermediate Packets (aka Projects). Hack your own motivation by breaking things down. Take some effort to make each piece consumable by your future self. Turn perishable things into longer lasting ones by taking the time to save them down in the right place and adding metadata like titles, quotes, page numbers. 
   
    8. **You Only Know What You Make** - Think of Learning and Working as the same thing. You're not done learning when you start work - but CV's look like that. Instead, think that the best way to learn is making something. When you make things, all the practical difficulties and holes in your knowledge come to life. Example - Book Summaries - instead of reading a book and putting it down, save notes, dive into ideas, and write summaries, and try to apply the ideas in a book summary. Don't pride yourself on quantity of books read. Read less, but really immerse in the ideas of each book. Add your own interpretations and metaphors. Become an expert on the book. Side benefits - Form a relationship with the author, build an audience, etc.

   9. **Make Things Easier for your Future Self** - Some people over time work harder and harder, some others work less and less. People live completely different lives as they get older - some super busy, some produce results with much less effort. The difference is leverage. Either day by day you are building some sort of accumulating leverage - blogs, savings, health. Intellectual leverage compounds over time. Makes it easier for future selves. Treat your future self as if that person was real. Impacts the way you eat, sleep, workout, and learn. It helps you act with more direction in future life. 

    10. **Keep Your Ideas Moving** - Don't get frustrated by being stuck. Move on. Let it stew in the back of your mind, as a Slow Burn. Often you will be working on it subconsciously. You will get stuck - so the solution is always have multiple things cooking. Translating ideas from one domain to the other. Problem with multitasking: you lose progress because you can't keep everything in your head. When you think and work externally it reaps the benefits of multitasking without the downsides. More important to stay in flow (maximum enjoyment, creativity, immersion) than have any particular outcome. Flow requires movement. Keep moving, and save things how you left it.

Words can't begin to express how much I love personal knowledge management. I feel like everything that I had been learning on my own all up to this point in my life fused into a smoothie of tranquility. I wish I had learned about this sooner, but I am grateful that I got to learn it now. I am thankful for Tiago Forte. Thanks to him I no longer drown in information, my maladaptive daydreaming has become an asset rather than a liability, I was able to escape tutorial hell, I was able to do something that I felt was difficult (applying information). Before I learned about this drug known as a Second Brain, I was an information hoarder. I was so good at collecting information I was almost indistinguishable from a spy. I used to think that filling my Brain with more and more information would result in greatness, but I wasn't. I was stuck with the same reasoning that destroyed my psychological wellbeing to begin with, school. Living for grades, tests, quizzes and cramming information hoping for a bright future. Building a Second Brain allowed me to unschool, unlearn and fully escape the effects of indoctrination. I give thanks to the idea of a Second Brain. For the first time it allowed me to realize that what I had been learning by chasing my curiosity wasn't useless, I had a large base of knowledge without even realizing it and most importantly I could use all of it. Its one thing to be overwhelmed with abundance, but that's not the case with a Second Brain. Information abundance is a blessing when it comes to a second Brain. Before I learned about the second Brain, I would say that "someday this will click" or "someday I will use this information, I think". I just need to read one more book, listen to one more podcast, take this course or do that then I will be good. That never happened. It felt like the more I accumulated the dumber I became. **How can a person surrounded by rich reservoirs of knowledge be unable to do anything?**  After learning about building a second Brain, the first thing that comes to mind is **how will I use this right now or later?** Building a Second Brain sparked curiosity and imagination of the inner child in me. I find myself asking myself lots of questions. Every markdown file I create contains questions and this file is no different. Thanks to Tiago Forte and his system of a Second Brain I can create stronger neural connections and find creative ways to solve problems in the midst of abundance and scarcity.

![](https://i.redd.it/1ctpb8dor8w61.png) 


1. <span style='background-color:#787878;'><span style='color:#000000;'>**What problems does a Second Brain solve?**
- Information overload
- Post traumatic growth
- Knowledge management (personal)
- Writers block or any creative block (creative output)
- Tutorial Hell (escape)
- Gas lighting

2. <span style='background-color:#46e8ff;'><span style='color:#000000;'>**What apps do I need to build a second brain?**
- Any note taking app that enables you to view folders (PARA),search functionality, markdown - if possible, lightweight (not Microsoft word), sync feature, Cross platform is a plus. 
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Markor](https://gsantner.net/project/markor.html)
- [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
- [Vscode](https://vscodium.com/) with [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/)
- [Roam](https://roamresearch.com)

3. <span style='background-color:#000000;'><span style='color:#46e8ff;'>**What is PARA?**
- an acronym that stands for Projects, Areas, Resources and Archive
- Projects are the things you want to do that are associated with a deadline
- Areas are things in your life that demand continuous improvement (self improvement doesn't expire)
-  Resources are the sources of content that you consume (podcasts, blogs, articles, courses, videos, songs...)
- Archive is the the resting place for your completed projects and ideas that you don't know what to do with just yet.

4. **What is CODE?**
- an acronym that stands for Collect, Organize, Distill & Express.
- Collect is the capture habit
- Organize is the knowledge factory, not a library
- Distill is the filter, the unused ideas are archived
- Express is the creative output of the knowledge factory

5. **How does a Second Brain work?**
- It involves 4 simple steps(CODE). You **collect** information by capturing it from whatever source you are consuming or random ideas that just light up in your Brain. You then **organize** that information into your folders (PARA). You then **distill** that information even further by filtering out what you don't need(archive). Finally you **express** everything into some creative output (design, song, blog post, publication, book...).

6. **Who is a Second Brain for?**
- Everyone (human beings)
- Knowledge workers (developers, researchers, teachers...)
- Entrepreneurs
- Freelancers
- Content creators 
- Productivity enthusiasts
- Self improvement enthusiasts
- Polyglots 

7. **Why build a Second Brain?**
- All the knowledge you already have/know will flow, the content you consume will connect and your future self will be in sync. 

8. **Is it possible to achieve transient Hypofrontality (flow) with a second Brain?**
- Its possible to do that with your first Brain, but that's something worth looking into. 

9. **Is procedural generation in computer science similar to the state of flow in Neuroscience?**
- worth looking into ....

10. **Is computational Neuroscience a thing?**
- Interesting word combo...

11. **What browser extensions/addone** can be used in tandem with a Second Brain?
- Readwise
- Memex

12. **How does a Second Brain minimize regret?**
-

13. **How can a person gamify their Second Brain?**
-

14. **Are there any rules associated with a Second Brain?**
- No rules, its just personal.

15. **Is it possible to create an offline Second Brain?**
- Yes, using paper & mind maps

16. **Are there any medical journals or research papers written on the Second Brain?**
-

17. **What are the benefits of a Second Brain in academia?**
-

18. **If you had discovered about a Second Brain earlier, how would your life have been different?**
-

19. **Does building a Second Brain magically grant success?**
-

20. **When you search the term, _Second Brain_, something about the gut pops up, are there any similarities and distinctions between that and this personal knowledge management system?**
-

21. **Which application is best for building a Second Brain?**
-

22. **What's the point of building a Second Brain, if the future will be run by robots, AI & automation?**
- Unique Human Intelligence...

23. **What are some of Second Brain styles you see around the internet?**
-

24. **How do you structure your Second Brain?**
- I use the PARA method, but the one thing I do different is that for every markdown file I add a details tag at the bottom called Q&A. I believe asking myself questions will help me get to the core of the file that I am looking at, helps with critical thinking and helps with storytelling ( interviews, casual conversation and what not)
- Gratitude
- Don't delete, just comment it out

25. **Who can take away your Second Brain from you?**
-

26. **Do you ommit anything from your Second Brain?**
- I believe a Second Brain should be unfiltered and you can write whatever you f•••••g want. Just be careful that you don't share it online. Keep it encrypted. Only share what you distil.

27. **What do you think about using Github or Gitlab as Second Brain?**
- Its a great idea, just be sure to keep the repositories private. The only drawback I find is that some of the scripts and HTML tags I add to my markdown don't render because Github has its own markdown flavor. I can't view colors and so forth.

28. **What can you lose from giving away your Second Brain?**
- You give up your ideas, even though it might take someone else time to make sense of your notes

29. **Whats the best markdown flavor for a Second Brain?**
- Whatever flavor allows me to render all HTML tags and scripts. Github flavored markdown is out of the picture 

30. **What's the best not taking file extension for a Second Brain?**
- Markdown hands down!

31. **Is using RMarkdown for a Second Brain a viable solution?**
- keep it super simple with regular markdown, but feel free to include other file formats for your projects and what not

32. **Is Emacs or Vim great for a Second Brain?**

# Building a site with Hugo

1: hugo new site <site name>

2: Pick a theme
> I wish i could pick one, but i'll eventually have to use all of them. Especially for product pages of my games.
[Mero](https://themes.gohugo.io/mero/)
- I like this theme because its dark and simple. My first pick

[Monopriv](https://themes.gohugo.io/monopriv/)
- This theme also speaks to me, but its kinda hard to decide between this and mero. However, i might as well use this one for my third site. One website isnt enough.

[Hugo Now](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-now/)
- Another one that i like. I'll defnitely use this one for another website

[Niello](https://themes.gohugo.io/niello/)
- Pure AMOLED theme

[Github Style](https://themes.gohugo.io/github-style/)
- Its kinda silly, but i love it.

[Zzo](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-zzo/)
- I am tempted to use this as my first theme over Mero, but for now i'll just use mero. Second site pick

[Dream](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-dream/)
- A very visually pleasing site. For the picture lover

[Docsy](https://themes.gohugo.io/docsy/)
- The gold standard for technical documentation

[Terminal](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-terminal/)
- Could use some improvements

[M10c](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-m10c/)
- Not a bad blog theme, but it kinda suffices
